// Create a function that splits a string of character depending on another string of characters.
// • You’ll have to use each character from the string charset as a separator.
// • The function returns an array where each box contains the address of a string wrapped between two separators. The last element of that array should equal to 0 to indicate the end of the array.
// • There cannot be any empty strings in your array. Draw your conclusions accord- ingly.
// • The string given as argument won’t be modifiable.
